Current Issues:
   Need to allow for delay to reset after X amount of time
      To get two of the same inputs in a row
   Sometimes multiple bits will be received

   Sending an entire string, not just one bit at a time

   Able to send 0's and 1's,
   Prevention would be to introduce more noise: still solid bitrate, and high error rate
   Prevention would be Tor protocol -> slow

   N Number of Random Bits and Measure Error Rate
   For Demo, Send set 16 bit user input string (1's and 0's) show same string on receiving end


error correcting codes

Seperate Network & Statistics Measurements (Improving the Mean)
   Stabilized Network, Two Computers (One local, One Remote)
   Table comparing results -> focus more on benefits of new approaches

Possiblity:
Prevention Strategy
Prevention of Data Exfiltration
